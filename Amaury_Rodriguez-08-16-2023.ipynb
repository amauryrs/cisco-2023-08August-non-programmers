    "3. Repeatedly ask the user to enter a string with numbers separated by whitespace.\n",
    "    - If the user enters an empty string, stop asking\n",
    "4. Go through each \"word\" in the string, one at a time.\n",
    "    - If it's not a number, then scold the user and go on to the next word\n",
    "    - If it's a number and lower than the threshold, append it to `lower`.\n",

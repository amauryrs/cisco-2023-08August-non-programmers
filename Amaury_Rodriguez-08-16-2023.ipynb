    "1. Define two empty lists, `higher` and `lower`.\n",
    "2. Ask the user to enter an integer, which we'll call `threshold`.\n",
    "3. Repeatedly ask the user to enter a string with numbers separated by whitespace.\n",
    "    - If the user enters an empty string, stop asking\n",
    "4. Go through each \"word\" in the string, one at a time.\n",
    "    - If it's not a number, then scold the user and go on to the next word\n",
    "    - If it's a number and lower than the threshold, append it to `lower`.\n",
    "    - If it's a number and higher (or equal to) the threshold, append it to `higher`.\n",
    "5. At the end print the elements of both `higher` and `lower`.\n",

    "    Enter a threshold: 10\n",

    "- Iterate over those words, one at a time\n",
    "- If the word cannot be turned into an integer, continue onto the next word\n",
    "- If the word *can* be turned into an integer, then check whether it's higher/lower than the threshold\n",
    "- Append to the appropriate list\n",

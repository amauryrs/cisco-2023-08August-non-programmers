    "The point of this program is to create a dictionary whose keys are characters and whose values indicate how many times each character appeared.\n",
    "We'll give the program the name of a file. Our program will read through the file, one line at a time, adding to the count for each character. So the end result will be a dict counting how often each character appears in the file.\n",
    "1. Define a variable `filename` that contains the name of a text file.\n",
    "2. Define a variable `counts`, an empty dict.\n",
    "3. Open and iterate over that file, one line at a time.\n",
    "4. Inside of that loop, start a new (inner/nested) loop, iterating over each character in the current line.\n",
    "    - If the character is already a key in `counts`, then just add 1 to the count\n",
    "    - If the character is not already a key in `counts`, then add the key and the value 1\n",
    "    - Note that we're counting all characters, including space, newline, etc.\n",
    "5. Iterate over the `counts` dict, printing all keys and values.\n",
    "Stage 1: Iterate over the lines of the file, and print them out.\n",
